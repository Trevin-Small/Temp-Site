  "29": "This is the long quote lol.<br><br><br>I love you so much abby. You mean so much to me, more than I can even express with words. There is nothing I value more in life than the people who I have truly meaningful relationships with, the people that I truly care about.<br>You, my brothers, my parents, those are the people who make life worth living. ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm incredibly lucky to have you in my life, to have someone so caring, so thoughtful, so loving, around me all the time. You're one of the best people I've ever met in my life, and I know you'll never stop being a great person.<br>I love everything about you, you're so smart, quick witted, funny, and very dedicated to the things that you're passionate about. One of the things I admire most about you is how you make decisions for yourself. Becoming a veggie gorl and picking a niche major in school that you're passionate about despite other people discouraging it are just two examples of that. I hope that it's a quality you never lose, and if anything, one that you continue to develop. I think making your own decisions rather than doing things because 'it's what society does / the norm is' is truly one of the keys to becoming the best version of yourself and living a fulfilling life.<br><br>Anyways, I'm excited to see what happens in the future. I have no idea where either of us will be or what we will be doing with our lives, and part of that scares me, but at the same time, it makes life feel like an adventure, and that makes living so much more interesting than everything being predictable.<br><br>Despite not knowing the future, I do know one thing; That I love you. ‚ù§Ô∏è :) And I look forward to every moment I get to spend with you.<br><br><br>With so much love,<br><br>- Trevin <3 :)"
